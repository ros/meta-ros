DESCRIPTION = "A composable container for Adaptive ROS 2 Node computations.     Allows building Nodes that can select between FPGA, CPU or     GPU, at run-time. Stateless by default, can be made stateful     to meet use-case specific needs. Refer to examples in README.      Technically, provides A ROS 2 Node subclass programmed as a     &quot;Component&quot; and including its own single threaded executor     to build adaptive computations. Adaptive ROS 2 Nodes are able to     perform computations in the CPU, the FPGA or the GPU, adaptively.     Adaptive behavior is controlled through the &quot;adaptive&quot; ROS 2     parameter."
