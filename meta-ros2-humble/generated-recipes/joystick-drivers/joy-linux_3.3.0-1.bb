DESCRIPTION = "ROS2 driver for a generic Linux joystick.     Will contain a MacOS and Windows version later.     The joy package contains joy_node, a node that interfaces a     generic Linux joystick to ROS2. This node publishes a &quot;Joy&quot;     message, which contains the current state of each one of the     joystick's buttons and axes."
