DESCRIPTION = "Streaming of OptiTrack mocap data to tf     <p>     This package contains a node that translates motion capture data from an     OptiTrack rig to tf transforms, poses and 2D poses. The node receives     packets that are streamed by a NatNet compliant source, decodes them and     broadcasts the poses of configured rigid bodies as tf transforms, poses,     and/or 2D poses.     </p>     <p>     Currently, this node supports the NatNet streaming protocol v3.0     </p>     <p>     Copyright (c) 2013, Clearpath Robotics<br/>      Copyright (c) 2010, University of Bonn, Computer Science Institute VI<br/>     All rights reserved.     </p>"
