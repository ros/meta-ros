DESCRIPTION = "The State Machine Compiler (SMC) from http://smc.sourceforge.net/     converts a language-independent description of a state machine     into the source code to support that state machine.      This package contains the libraries that a compiled state machine     depends on, but it does not contain the compiler itself."
