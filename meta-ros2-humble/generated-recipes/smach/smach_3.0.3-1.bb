DESCRIPTION = "SMACH is a task-level architecture for rapidly creating complex robot     behavior. At its core, SMACH is a ROS-independent Python library to build     hierarchical state machines. SMACH is a new library that takes advantage of     very old concepts in order to quickly create robust robot behavior with     maintainable and modular code."
