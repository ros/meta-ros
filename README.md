# UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

The original implementation of `meta-ros` for ROS 1 Indigo Igloo
(<https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros> was transferred here on 2019-06-25. It
is in the process of being upgraded to be able to build current ROS 1 and ROS 2
distros (Crystal Clemmys, Dashing Diademata, and eventually Melodic Morenia and
Bouncy Bolson) from recipes generated by
[superflore](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/superflore/) and might not be
usable for a little while. Please see this
[wiki page](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Superflore-OE-Recipe-Generation-Scheme)
for details of what is being done. Draft versions of these changes are in this branch.

The original implementation has been retained in the [`legacy`](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/tree/legacy) branch.
