# `meta-ros` - OpenEmbedded Layer for ROS

`meta-ros` is an OpenEmbedded layer designed to provide support for the Robot Operating System (ROS) in OpenEmbedded and Yocto environments. It empowers developers to create tailored Linux-based robotic systems, taking advantage of both ROS's capabilities and the flexibility of Yocto.

**This repository is currently being maintained by community volunteers and industry contributions**. <u>If you need support, reach out to any of the maintainers and/or contributors</u>.

## Current Support

The `master` branch serves as a general overview and reference point. To find support details specific to each Yocto release, please navigate to the corresponding branch in this repository.

- Refer to the branch named after the desired Yocto release series.
- Each branch provides a detailed breakdown of supported ROS versions and any associated known issues or limitations.

## A Brief History

- **Original Implementation for ROS 1**: The first iteration of `meta-ros` for ROS 1 Indigo Igloo can be found [here](https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros). It was transferred to this repository on 2019-06-25.

- **ROS 2 Port by Erle Robotics**: The initial porting of ROS 2 to Yocto was undertaken by Erle Robotics. Their work was disclosed at [this repository](https://github.com/erlerobot/meta-ros2/) and was later integrated upstream into the `meta-ros` repository.

- **Recipe Generation**: The project now uses recipes generated by [superflore](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/superflore/). For insights into the transition and the associated development milestones, refer to this [wiki page](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Superflore-OE-Recipe-Generation-Scheme).

- **Legacy Version**: If you're interested in the original implementation, it's preserved in the [`legacy`](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/tree/legacy) branch.
