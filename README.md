# Branch `[dunfell]` (UNSUPPORTED)

The **dunfell** OpenEmbedded release series has reached its EOL (see
https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases). Following the
[OpenEmbedded Release Series Support Policy](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Policies#openembedded-release-series-support),
support for ROS distro releases newer than those of Milestone 17 (2020-07-04)
have not been added to this branch, and building with **dunfell** is no
longer supported.

Instructions for using `meta-ros` are
[here](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions).

## Status

With the exception of the commits added to complete Milestone 17, this repository
has not been maintained since December 2021. Its future maintenance was
discussed in the
[OSRF TSC January 2022 meeting post](https://discourse.ros.org/t/os-2-tsc-meeting-january-20th-2022/23986/2).

## History

The original implementation of `meta-ros` for ROS 1 Indigo Igloo
(<https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros>) was transferred here on 2019-06-25. It
has been converted to use recipes generated by
[superflore](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/superflore/). Please see this
[wiki page](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Superflore-OE-Recipe-Generation-Scheme)
for details of what was done and the current development milestones.

The original implementation has been retained in the
[`legacy`](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/tree/legacy) branch.
