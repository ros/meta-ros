DESCRIPTION = "Tools for directing, throttling, selecting, and otherwise messing with     ROS topics at a meta level. None of the programs in this package actually     know about the topics whose streams they are altering; instead, these     tools deal with messages as generic binary blobs. This means they can be     applied to any ROS topic."
