DESCRIPTION = "<p>          gmcl, which stands for general monte carlo localization,          is a probabilistic-based localization technique for mobile robots in          2D-known map. It integrates the adaptive monte carlo localization          - amcl - approach with three different particle filter algorithms (Optimal, Intelligent,          Self-adaptive) to improve the performance while working in real time.                                </p>         <p>          Main node structure and amcl-algorithmsâ€™s code was derived, with thanks, from Brian Gerkey's amcl package.              </p>"
