DESCRIPTION = "This package is composed of 'dynamixel_item', 'dynamixel_tool', 'dynamixel_driver' and 'dynamixel_workbench' class.     The 'dynamixel_item' is saved as control table item and information of Dynamixels.     The 'dynamixel_tool' class loads its by model number of Dynamixels.     The 'dynamixel_driver' class includes wraped function used in DYNAMIXEL SDK.     The 'dynamixel_workbench' class make simple to use Dynamixels"
