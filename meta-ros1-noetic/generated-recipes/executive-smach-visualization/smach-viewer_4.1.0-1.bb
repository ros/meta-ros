DESCRIPTION = "The smach viewer is a GUI that shows the state of hierarchical     SMACH state machines. It can visualize the possible transitions     between states, as well as the currently active state and the     values of user data that is passed around between states. The     smach viewer uses the SMACH debugging interface based on     the <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/smach_msgs">smach     messages</a> to gather information from running state machines."
