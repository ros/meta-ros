DESCRIPTION = "<p>       ROS-Industrial support package for the Fanuc R-2000iB (and variants).     </p>     <p>       This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files       for Fanuc R-2000iB manipulators. This currently includes the /210F       variant only.     </p>     <p><b>Specifications</b>:</p>     <ul>       <li>R-2000iB/210F - &quot;J1 - Normal Range&quot;</li>     </ul>     <p>       Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in       the <em>FANUC R-2000iB Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual</em>       version <em>B-82234EN/11</em>. All urdfs are based on the default motion       and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for       high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options).     </p>     <p>       Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included       in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular       robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.     </p>"
