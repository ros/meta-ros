DESCRIPTION = "<p>       ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc M-20iB (and variants).     </p>     <p>       This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files       for Fanuc M-20iB manipulators. This currently includes the /25 model only.     </p>     <p><b>Specifications</b>:</p>     <ul>       <li>M-20iB/25 - &quot;Cable integrated J3 Arm&quot;</li>     </ul>     <p>       Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in       the <em>FANUC Robot M-20iB Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual</em> version       <em>B-83754EN/01</em>. All urdfs are based on the default motion and       joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high       speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options).     </p>     <p>       Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included       in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular       robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.     </p>"
