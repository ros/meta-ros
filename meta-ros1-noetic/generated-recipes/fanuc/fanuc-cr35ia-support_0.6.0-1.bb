DESCRIPTION = "<p>       ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc CR-35iA (and variants).     </p>     <p>       This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files       for Fanuc CR-35iA manipulators. This currently includes the base model       only.     </p>     <p><b>Specifications</b>:</p>     <ul>       <li>CR-35iA - Normal Range</li>     </ul>     <p>       Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in       the <em>FANUC Robot CR-35iA Mechanical Unit Operator's Manual</em> version       <em>B-83734EN/01</em>. All urdfs are based on the default motion and       joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high       speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options).     </p>     <p>       Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included       in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular       robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.     </p>     <p>       <b>Note</b>: there is currently some confusion over the correct values for       the joint limits of joints 2 and 3. Version <em>B-83734EN/01</em> of the       Operator's Manual incorrectly states that 1.05 rad equals 120 degrees,       and that 0.39 rad equals 45 degrees (joint 2). Additionally, it gives a       value of -122.9 degrees for the lower limit of joint 3, whereas (at       least) Roboguide Rev K have this limit set to -182 degrees.       We advise users to pay extra attention when verifying the xacro in this       support package until this is cleared up.     </p>"
