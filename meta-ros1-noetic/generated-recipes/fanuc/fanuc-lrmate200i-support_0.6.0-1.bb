DESCRIPTION = "<p>       ROS-Industrial support for the Fanuc LR Mate 200i.     </p>     <p>       This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files       for Fanuc LR Mate 200i manipulators. This currently includes the       base model only.     </p>     <p>       Joint limits and maximum joint velocities are based on the information in       the <em>FANUC Robotics LR Mate 200i Datasheet</em> version       <em>FRNA-10/9-DS-005</em>. All urdfs are based on the default motion       and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for       high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or other options).     </p>     <p>       Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included       in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular       robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.     </p>"
