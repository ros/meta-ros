DESCRIPTION = "This package allows you to publish the state of a robot to     <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/tf2">tf2</a>. Once the state gets published, it is     available to all components in the system that also use <tt>tf2</tt>.     The package takes the joint angles of the robot as input     and publishes the 3D poses of the robot links, using a kinematic     tree model of the robot."
