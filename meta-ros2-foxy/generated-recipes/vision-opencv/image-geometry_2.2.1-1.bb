DESCRIPTION = "`image_geometry` contains C++ and Python libraries for interpreting images     geometrically. It interfaces the calibration parameters in sensor_msgs/CameraInfo     messages with OpenCV functions such as image rectification, much as cv_bridge     interfaces ROS sensor_msgs/Image with OpenCV data types."
