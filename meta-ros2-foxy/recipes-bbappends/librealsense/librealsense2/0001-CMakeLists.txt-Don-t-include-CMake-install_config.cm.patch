Subject: [PATCH] CMakeLists.txt: Don't include CMake/install_config.cmake
 twice

* it duplicates the export for realsense2 and causes cmake to fail with:
-- Configuring done
CMake Error: install(EXPORT "realsense2Targets" ...) includes target "realsense2" more than once in the export set.
CMake Error: install(EXPORT "realsense2Targets" ...) includes target "realsense2" more than once in the export set.
CMake Error: install(EXPORT "realsense2-glTargets" ...) includes target "realsense2-gl" which requires target "realsense2" that is not in this export set, but in multiple other export sets: lib/cmake/realsense2/realsense2Targets.cmake, lib/cmake/realsense2/realsense2Targets.cmake.
An exported target cannot depend upon another target which is exported multiple times. Consider consolidating the exports of the "realsense2" target to a single export.

* it's already included couple lines above where it was moved in
  upstream commit:
  https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/commit/a54832ab557ff49b24e5840af9e44206a3b655ef

* but the 2nd install_config.cmake include wasn't removed when importing
  this to ros2-gbp/librealsense-release:
  https://github.com/ros2-gbp/librealsense-release/commit/1469d905f04345b4039672dbd501886ba32f5061#diff-af3b638bc2a3e6c650974192a53c7291R130
