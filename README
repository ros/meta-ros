This is a layer to provide ROS in an OpenEmbedded Linux system.
Currently, this layer is still under development and not fully functional.

PURPOSE of this document:
  This document describes
  - the state of the current work
  - the installation and use of the git repository meta_ros 
  - license information and origin of redistributed files


STATE OF THIS WORK:

  This repository provides
  - Native compilation of ROS-fuerte
  - Native compilation of ROS-groovy
  - Cross compilation of ROS-groovy (under development)

INSTALLATION/SETUP:
  The repository only contains a layer for ROS that builds on top of the existing OpenEmbedded Core layer.
  Currently, I work with
    * commit 2587a33134fde80dd1367629d9def45ac70256ee of https://github.com/openembedded/oe-core
    * commit 324ed96e28ec31cff8cef1824d20d40f9a5d46ad of git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake in the bitbake directory


USE for cross-compilation of ROS-groovy (in development):

  Currently, we can cross-compile the ROS packages with the commands:
  source oe-init-build-env
  bitbake <package-name>

  Look at the meta-ros test reports for the description of the current state.


PREVIOUS USE CASES


INSTALLATION:

  The repository only contains a layer for ROS that builds on top of the existing OpenEmbedded Core layer.
  You can download the yocto poky-danny-8.0 archive, but then you should update the distutils.bbclass,
  and maybe also the url of libarchive.
  To install, unpack http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/yocto-1.3/poky-danny-8.0.tar.bz2 into a directory <dir>.
  
  In the directory of the layers, clone this repository into the subdirectory meta-ros. 
  Add the meta-ros directory to your local bblayers.conf file.


USE for native compilation of ROS-fuerte on the qemu VM:
  The commands
    source oe-init-build-env
    bitbake core-image-ros-fuerte
  builds our specifically configured linux image.
  
  With `runqemu qemux86 qemuparams="-m 2048" core-image-ros-fuerte` the linux image runs within a virtual machine with 2048 MB of memory.
  We assumed that this is running on and compiled for an x86 architecture. For other architectures, some settings must be adjusted.
  
  On the host system, run fetch-ros-fuerte.sh in a fresh directory, e.g. ~/ros-repos/.
  It clones all ros repositories locally.
  After starting the virtual machine, copy the installation script from the host system to the home directory with scp.
  
    scp lukas@192.168.7.1:/<location of repository>/install-fuerte.sh .

  Adjust configuration in install-fuerte.sh and then run

    sh ./install-fuerte.sh
  
  The installation script installs ros and starts roscore.


USE for native compilation of ROS-groovy on the qemu VM:
  The commands
    source oe-init-build-env
    bitbake core-image-ros-groovy
  builds our specifically configured linux image.
  
  With `runqemu qemux86 qemuparams="-m 2048" core-image-ros-groovy` the linux image runs within a virtual machine with 2048 MB of memory.
  We assumed that this is running on and compiled for an x86 architecture. For other architectures, some settings must be adjusted.
  
  On the host system, run mk_srcarchive.sh in some clean temporary directory.
  It copies all ros sources from their URLs and puts them into one src.tar.gz archive.
  After starting the virtual machine, copy the installation script from the host system to the home directory with scp.
  
    scp lukas@192.168.7.1:/<location of repository>/install-groovy.sh .

  Adjust configuration in install-groovy.sh and then run

    sh ./install-groovy.sh
  
  The installation script installs ros and starts roscore.
