The ament_cmake_vendor_package uses "opt/${PROJECT_NAME}" as the default
install destination. This causes vendor packages like uncrustify-vendor
to fail package QA tests:

  ERROR: uncrustify-vendor-2.2.1-1-r0 do_package: QA Issue: uncrustify-vendor: Files/directories were installed but not shipped in any package:                                                                      /usr/opt/uncrustify_vendor/bin/uncrustify
  Please set FILES such that these items are packaged. Alternatively if they are unneeded, avoid installing them or delete them within do_install.                                                                 uncrustify-vendor: 1 installed and not shipped files. [installed-vs-shipped]

The DESTINATION option must be set.  In order to ensure that it resolves
to /usr without hardcoding it we use "." to provide a relative path.
