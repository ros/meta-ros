DESCRIPTION = "Wrapper around yaml-cpp, it provides a fixed CMake module."

# We arrange for the platform yaml-cpp to be built from the same commit as that from which the ExternalProject is built. If the
# commit changes, the patch will not apply cleanly and we'll know we need to update the .bbappend for yaml-cpp.
