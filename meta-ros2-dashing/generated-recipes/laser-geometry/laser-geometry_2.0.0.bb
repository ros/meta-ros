DESCRIPTION = "This package contains a class for converting from a 2D laser scan as defined by     sensor_msgs/LaserScan into a point cloud as defined by sensor_msgs/PointCloud     or sensor_msgs/PointCloud2. In particular, it contains functionality to account     for the skew resulting from moving robots or tilting laser scanners."
