DESCRIPTION = "This stack provides Python bindings for Qt.     There are two providers: pyside and pyqt.  PySide2 is available under     the GPL, LGPL and a commercial license.  PyQt is released under the GPL.      Both the bindings and tools to build bindings are included from each     available provider.  For PySide, it is called &quot;Shiboken&quot;.  For PyQt,     this is called &quot;SIP&quot;.      Also provided is adapter code to make the user's Python code     independent of which binding provider was actually used which makes     it very easy to switch between these."
