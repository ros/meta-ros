DESCRIPTION = "rqt_action provides a feature to introspect all available ROS   action types. By utilizing rqt_msg, the output format is   unified with it and rqt_srv. Note that the actions shown on this plugin   is the ones that are stored on your machine, not on the ROS core your rqt   instance connects to."
