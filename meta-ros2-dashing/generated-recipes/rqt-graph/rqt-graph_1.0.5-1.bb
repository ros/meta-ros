DESCRIPTION = "rqt_graph provides a GUI plugin for visualizing the ROS       computation graph.<br/>       Its components are made generic so that other packages       where you want to achieve graph representation can depend upon this pkg       (use <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/rqt_dep">rqt_dep</a> to find out       the pkgs that depend. rqt_dep itself depends on rqt_graph too)."
