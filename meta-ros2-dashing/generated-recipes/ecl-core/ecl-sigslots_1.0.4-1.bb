DESCRIPTION = "Provides a signal/slot mechanism (in the same vein as qt sigslots,      boost::signals etc for intra-process communication. These include      some improvements - they do not need a preprocessor, are fully type safe,      allow for simple connections via a posix style string identifier      and are multithread-safe."
