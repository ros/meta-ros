DESCRIPTION = "Interprocess mechanisms vary greatly across platforms - sysv, posix, win32, there   are more than a few. This package provides an infrastructure to allow for developing   cross platform c++ wrappers around the lower level c api's that handle these   mechanisms. These make it not only easier to utilise such mechanisms, but allow it   to be done consistently across platforms."
