DESCRIPTION = "<p>       MoveIt kinematics plugin for industrial robots.     </p>     <p>       This plugin uses an analytical inverse kinematic library, opw_kinematics,       to calculate the inverse kinematics for industrial robots with 6 degrees of freedom,       two parallel joints, and a spherical wrist.     </p>"
