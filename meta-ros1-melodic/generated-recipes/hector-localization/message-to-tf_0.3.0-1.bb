DESCRIPTION = "message_to_tf translates pose information from different kind of common_msgs message types to tf. Currently the node supports nav_msgs/Odometry, geometry_msgs/PoseStamped and sensor_msgs/Imu messages as input.     The resulting transform is divided into three subtransforms with intermediate frames for the footprint and the stabilized base frame (without roll and pitch)."
