DESCRIPTION = "ROS-enabled OpenManipulator is a full open robot platform consisting of OpenSoftware​, OpenHardware and OpenCR(Embedded board)​.     The OpenManipulator is allowed users to control it more easily by linking with the MoveIt! package. Moreover it has full hardware compatibility with TurtleBot3​.      Even if you do not have a real robot, you can control the robot in the Gazebo simulator​."
