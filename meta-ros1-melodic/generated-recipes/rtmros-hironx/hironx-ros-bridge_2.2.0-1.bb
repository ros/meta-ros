DESCRIPTION = "ROS-OpenRTM interfacing package for the opensource version of Kawada's Hiro/NEXTAGE dual-arm robot.    NOTE: This package is multi-license -- pay attention to file header in each file where license is declared. For Creative Commons nc 4.0 applied, see <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0">here</a>.    <p>This package also contains some sensor driver software (as of April 2016 they are the following force sensors such as <a href="http://www.wacoh-tech.com/products/dynpick/wdf-6m200-3.html">Dynpick</a> and <a href="http://www.jr3.com/products.html">JR3</a>) for QNX. These drivers are stored in this robot-specific package for not many reasons than they are slightly customized for the robot. So if you can separate those as a standalone, generic package that'll be appreciated (please just let us know if you will).</p>"
