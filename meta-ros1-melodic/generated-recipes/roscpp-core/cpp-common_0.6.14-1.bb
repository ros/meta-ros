DESCRIPTION = "cpp_common contains C++ code for doing things that are not necessarily ROS     related, but are useful for multiple packages. This includes things like     the ROS_DEPRECATED and ROS_FORCE_INLINE macros, as well as code for getting     backtraces.      This package is a component of <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/roscpp">roscpp</a>."
