DESCRIPTION = "rqt_robot_monitor displays diagnostics_agg topics messages that    are published by <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/diagnostic_aggregator">diagnostic_aggregator</a>.    rqt_robot_monitor is a direct port to rqt of    <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/robot_monitor">robot_monitor</a>. All    diagnostics are fall into one of three tree panes depending on the status of    diagnostics (normal, warning, error/stale). Status are shown in trees to    represent their hierarchy. Worse status dominates the higher level status.<br/>    <ul>     Ex. 'Computer' category has 3 sub devices. 2 are green but 1 is error. Then         'Computer' becomes error.    </ul>   You can look at the detail of each status by double-clicking the tree nodes.<br/>    Currently re-usable API to other pkgs are not explicitly provided."
