DESCRIPTION = "The follower demo was implemented using a 360 Laser Distance Sensor LDS-01. The classification algorithm is used based on previous fitting with samples of person and obstacles positions to take actions. It follows someone in front of the robot within a 50 centimeter range and 140 degrees."
