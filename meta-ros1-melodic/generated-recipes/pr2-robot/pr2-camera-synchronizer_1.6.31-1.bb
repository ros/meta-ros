DESCRIPTION = "<p>     The PR2 is equipped with a texture projector that can be used to     project a texture onto featureless surfaces, allowing their     three-dimensional structure to be determined using stereoscopy. The     projector operates in a pulsed mode, producing brief (2ms) pulses of     light. Cameras that want to see the texture must expose during the     projector pulse; other cameras should be expose while the projector is     off.     </p>      <p>       This package contains the pr2_projector_synchronizer node. Based on its dynamically reconfigurable parameters, this node controls the projector pulsing, and sets up triggering of the WGE100 cameras.     </p>"
