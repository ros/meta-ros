DESCRIPTION = "This rqt plugin succeeds former dynamic_reconfigure's GUI     (reconfigure_gui), and provides the way to view and edit the parameters     that are accessible via dynamic_reconfigure.<br/>     <br/>     (12/27/2012) In the future, arbitrary parameters that are not associated     with any nodes (which are not handled by dynamic_reconfigure) might     become handled.     However, currently as the name indicates, this pkg solely is dependent     on dynamic_reconfigure that allows access to only those params latched     to nodes."
