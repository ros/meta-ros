DESCRIPTION = "The lockfree package contains lock-free data structures for use in multithreaded programming.  These      kinds of data structures are generally not as easy to use as single-threaded equivalents, and are not      always faster.  If you don't know you need to use one, try another structure with a lock around it      first."
