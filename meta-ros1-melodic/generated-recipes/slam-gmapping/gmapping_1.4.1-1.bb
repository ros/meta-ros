DESCRIPTION = "This package contains a ROS wrapper for OpenSlam's Gmapping.    The gmapping package provides laser-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping),    as a ROS node called slam_gmapping. Using slam_gmapping, you can create a 2-D occupancy   grid map (like a building floorplan) from laser and pose data collected by a mobile robot."
