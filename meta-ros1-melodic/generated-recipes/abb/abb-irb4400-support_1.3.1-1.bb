DESCRIPTION = "<p>       ROS-Industrial support for the ABB IRB 4400 (and variants).     </p>     <p>       This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files       for ABB IRB 4400 manipulators. This currently includes the L30.     </p>     <p>       Joint limits and max joint velocities are based on the information in the       <a href="http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot352.nsf/veritydisplay/c90b98aaa057bd6ec12576cb00528ef6/$file/Product%20specification%204400%20M99%20BWOS3.2.pdf">       ABB IRB 4400 product specification document</a> (Article No: 3HAC 8770-1).       All urdfs / xacros are based on the default motion and joint velocity       limits, unless noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints,       extended / limited motion ranges or other options).     </p>     <p>       Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included       in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular       robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.     </p>"
