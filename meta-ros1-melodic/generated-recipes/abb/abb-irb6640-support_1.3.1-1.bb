DESCRIPTION = "<p>       ROS-Industrial support for the ABB IRB 6640 (and variants).     </p>     <p>       This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files       for ABB IRB 6640 manipulators. This currently includes the       IRB 6640-185/2.8m (6640-185) only.     </p>     <p>       Joint limits and max joint velocities are based on the information in the       <a href="http://www.abbrobots.co.uk/en/3HAC028284-en.pdf">ABB IRB 6640       technical data sheet</a> (Version: 3HAC 028284-001 Rev. N). All urdfs /       xacros are based on the default motion and joint velocity limits, unless       noted otherwise (ie: no support for high speed joints, extended / limited       motion ranges or other options).     </p>     <p>       Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included       in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular       robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.     </p>"
