DESCRIPTION = "SMACH, which stands for 'state machine', is a task-level     architecture for rapidly creating complex robot behavior. At its     core, SMACH is a ROS-independent Python library to build     hierarchical state machines.  SMACH is a new library that takes     advantage of very old concepts in order to quickly create robust     robot behavior with maintainable and modular code."
