DESCRIPTION = "Facilities to monitor a network connection by sending UDP packets from     a client to a server, which bounces them back to the client. The client     collects statistics on latency and loss. The server is a C standalone utility     or a ROS node. The client can be a ROS node, a standalone utility or a python class."
