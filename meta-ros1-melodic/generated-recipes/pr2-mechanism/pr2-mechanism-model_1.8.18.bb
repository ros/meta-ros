DESCRIPTION = "<p>         This package contains the robot model that is used by the realtime         controllers         inside <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/pr2_controller_manager">controller            manager</a>. This robot model focuses on controlling the robot         mechanism in a realtime control loop, and therefore it only contains         the components of a robot that are relevant in realtime: the robot         joints (with encoders, transmisisons and actuators) and the         kinematic/dynamic model of the robot.      </p>      <p>         The pr2_mechanism_model package is well tested and is released with a stable API.      </p>"
