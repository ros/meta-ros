DESCRIPTION = "A multiplexer for command velocity inputs. Arbitrates incoming cmd_vel messages from several topics,      allowing one topic at a time to command the robot, based on priorities. It also deallocates current      allowed topic if no messages are received after a configured timeout. All topics, together with their      priority and timeout are configured through a YAML file, that can be reload at runtime."
