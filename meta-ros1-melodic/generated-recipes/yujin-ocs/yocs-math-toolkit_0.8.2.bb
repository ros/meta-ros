DESCRIPTION = "Math toolkit for Yujin open control system. This package is intended to contain common use functions,     mostly for simple mathematics but also for tf-related conversions.     By no means it pretends to be an efficient and robust, widely used math library, but a play ground where     to put common code that is typically repeated in many robot control programs."
