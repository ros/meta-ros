DESCRIPTION = "HyQ-robot specific functions for visualization in the  XPP Motion Framework.          These include inverse kinematics as well as urdf files for a one-legged,     two-legged and four legged robot with <a href="http://dls.iit.it/">HyQ</a>     legs.              The dynamic model can be found      <a href="https://github.com/iit-DLSLab/hyq-description">here</a>.            See also <a href="https://dls.iit.it">IIT</a>."
