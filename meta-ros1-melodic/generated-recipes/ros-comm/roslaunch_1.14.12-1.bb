DESCRIPTION = "roslaunch is a tool for easily launching multiple ROS <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/Nodes">nodes</a> locally and remotely     via SSH, as well as setting parameters on the <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/Parameter Server">Parameter     Server</a>. It includes options to automatically respawn processes     that have already died. roslaunch takes in one or more XML     configuration files (with the <tt>.launch</tt> extension) that     specify the parameters to set and nodes to launch, as well as the     machines that they should be run on."
