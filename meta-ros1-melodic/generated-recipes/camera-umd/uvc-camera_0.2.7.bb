DESCRIPTION = "A collection of node(let)s that stream images from USB cameras (UVC)      and provide CameraInfo messages to consumers. Includes a      two-camera node that provides rough synchronization      for stereo vision.       Currently uses the base driver from Morgan Quigley's uvc_cam package."
