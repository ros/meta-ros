DESCRIPTION = "<p>             amcl is a probabilistic localization system for a robot moving in             2D. It implements the adaptive (or KLD-sampling) Monte Carlo             localization approach (as described by Dieter Fox), which uses a             particle filter to track the pose of a robot against a known map.         </p>         <p>             This node is derived, with thanks, from Andrew Howard's excellent             'amcl' Player driver.         </p>"
