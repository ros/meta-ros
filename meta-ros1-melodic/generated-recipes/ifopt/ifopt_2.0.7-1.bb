DESCRIPTION = "An <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org">Eigen-</a>     based interface to Nonlinear Programming solver     <a href="https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt">Ipopt</a>.      Inuitive and efficient C++ implementation of variables, costs and      constraints using Eigen. Easy integration in your projects in catkin     or pure cmake."
