DESCRIPTION = "A light-weight, Eigen-based     C++ library for trajectory optimization for legged robots.      This library provides implementations for variables, costs and constraints     that can be used to represent a legged locomotion problem.      The resulting Nonlinear Programming Problem (NLP) can then be solved with     off-the-shelf solvers, e.g. Ipopt using the generic optimizer interface      <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/ifopt">ifopt</a>."
