DESCRIPTION = "The video_stream_opencv package contains a node to publish a video stream (the protocols that     opencv supports are supported, including rtsp, webcams on /dev/video and video files) in ROS image topics, it supports camera info and basic image flipping (horizontal, vertical or both) capabilities, also adjusting publishing rate."
