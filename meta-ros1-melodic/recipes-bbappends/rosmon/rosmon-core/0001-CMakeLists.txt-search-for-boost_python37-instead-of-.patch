Subject: [PATCH] CMakeLists.txt: search for boost_python37 instead of just
 boost_python

* as described in
  https://github.com/espressopp/espressopp/issues/277

The core of the issue can be found in FindBoost.cmake:

Note that Boost Python components require a Python version suffix
(Boost 1.67 and later), e.g. python36 or python27 for the
versions built against Python 3.6 and 2.7, respectively.

This basically means for Boost-1.67 and later, we need to check for the
python27 component instead of just python, however this feature is only
supported in cmake-3.11 and newer.
