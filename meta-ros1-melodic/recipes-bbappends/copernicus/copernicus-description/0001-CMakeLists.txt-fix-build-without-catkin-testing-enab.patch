Subject: [PATCH] CMakeLists.txt: fix build without catkin testing enabled

* use CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING conditional as suggested in:
  http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch#Catkin
* it's not really clear that roslaunch_add_file_check shouldn't
  be called at all or roslaunch_add_file_check should check CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING
  before trying to call catkin_run_tests_target inside
* see:
  https://answers.ros.org/question/200359/purpose-of-roslaunch_add_file_check/
  similar fix for imu_transformer in gentoo:
  https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/commit/452c8600bbe989ad3b4f06211cdbdccfe5eb2f52
