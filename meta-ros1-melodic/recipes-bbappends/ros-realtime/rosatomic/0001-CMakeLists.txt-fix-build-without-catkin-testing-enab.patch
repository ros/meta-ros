Subject: [PATCH] CMakeLists.txt: fix build without catkin testing enabled

* use CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING conditional as suggested in
  http://docs.ros.org/jade/api/catkin/html/howto/format2/gtest_configuration.html
* otherwise do_configure fails with:
  recipe-sysroot-native/opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/test/tests.cmake:18 (message):
  () is not available when tests are not enabled.  The CMake code should only
  use it inside a conditional block which checks that testing is enabled:

  if(CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING)

    (...)

  endif()
