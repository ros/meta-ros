DESCRIPTION = "tf2 is the second generation of the transform library, which lets     the user keep track of multiple coordinate frames over time. tf2     maintains the relationship between coordinate frames in a tree     structure buffered in time, and lets the user transform points,     vectors, etc between any two coordinate frames at any desired     point in time."
