DESCRIPTION = "The rc_dynamics_api provides an API for easy handling of the dynamic-state data       streams provided by Roboception's stereo camera with self-localization.       See http://rc-visard.com        Dynamic-state estimates of the rc_visard relate to its self-localization and       ego-motion estimation. These states refer to rc_visard's current pose,       velocity, or acceleration and are published on demand via several data streams.       For a complete list and descriptions of these dynamics states and the       respective data streams please refer to rc_visard's user manual."
