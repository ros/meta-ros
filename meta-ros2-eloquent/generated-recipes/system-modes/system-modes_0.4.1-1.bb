DESCRIPTION = "The system modes concept assumes that a robotics system is built     from components with a lifecycle. It adds a notion of (sub-)systems,     hiararchically grouping these nodes, as well as a notion of modes     that determine the configuration of these nodes and (sub-)systems in     terms of their parameter values."
