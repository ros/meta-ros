DESCRIPTION = "A set of plugins for publishing and subscribing to sensor_msgs/Image topics     in representations other than raw pixel data. For example, for viewing a     stream of images off-robot, a video codec will give much lower bandwidth     and latency. For low frame rate tranport of high-definition images, you     might prefer sending them as JPEG or PNG-compressed form."
